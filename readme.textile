h1. Webshims-rails

Easily include the "webshims library":http://aFarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html (by Alexander Farkas) in your Rails 3.1+ project with the asset pipeline.

h2. Usage

1. Add webshims-rails to your Gemfile for bundler: @gem 'webshims-rails'@
2. Require modernizr and the webshims polyfiller, eg, in your application.js:

<pre>
//= require webshims/minified/extras/modernizr-custom
//= require webshims/minified/polyfiller
</pre>

3. In your javascript, after the polyfiller has been required, set the basePath for webshims as shown below, and then call $.webshims.polyfill(); see webshims docs for more options.
(Note that this should be run directly, not in a dom-ready block.)

<pre>
  $.webshims.setOptions('basePath', '/assets/webshims/minified/shims/')
  $.webshims.polyfill()
</pre>
